# SchoolUniform
This is a Java console app which allows a user to purchase school uniforms and save the invoice to XML or JSON
The project was intended to demonstrate a strategy pattern which allows the user to create their invoice into a JSON or XML file, and allow for any other file type to be included without changing the main method code.
